# ecRhtoGEM
### Brief repository description:
* This repository contains the work on metabolic engineering of oleaginous, non-conventional yeast *R.toruloides* using genome-scale modelling.

* Repository consists of model files, scripts and files for visualisations of microbial metabolic networks.

#### Model files (xml, xlsx, mat, json)
* As a starting point for this work, a metabolic genome-scale model, named **rhto-GEM**, developed by [Tiukova et al. 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bit.27162), was used.
* The initial model files used in this work are available [here](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/rhto-GEM).

#### Scripts (ipynb, m)
* The scripts were written in Matlab R2018b and Jupyter Notebook (Python) from [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) software (as an alternative to full [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)).
* The modelling was done with the [COBRApy](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy), RAVEN and COBRA toolboxes.
* The documentation of COBRApy is browseable online at [readthedocs](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

#### Visualisations (json)
* Metabolic network maps were constructed using [Escher](https://escher.github.io/#/) software.
* The results were directly visualised in Jupyter Notebook using Escher Python package.
* The documentation of Escher is browseable [here](https://escher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
