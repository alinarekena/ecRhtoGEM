function [absUsage,capUsage,UB,protId] = enzymeUsage(ecModel,fluxes,zero)
% enzymeUsage
%
%   Gives enzyme usages based on a provided flux distribution. It can give:
%   1)  absolute usage: the specific enzyme usage in mmol/gDCW/h, which can
%       be given for enzymes both with- and without abundance information;
%   2)  capacity usage: the ratio of available enzyme that is used, calcuted
%       by (absUsage/UB) (note that capacity usage is 0 if an enzyme
%       abundance was not constrained in the model);
%   3)  UB: the upper bound of each enzyme exchange reaction;
%   4)  protId: the protein identifiers for each enzyme (if the model has an
%       enzymes field than this order is used, otherwise it is given
%       alphabetically.
%
%   Input:
%   ecModel         enzyme-constrained model
%   fluxes          vector of fluxes, for instance sol.x
%   zero            logical whether also zero absolute enzyme usages should be
%                   included (opt, default true)
%
%   Output:
%   capUsage        vector of enzyme capacity usages
%   absUsage        vector of absolute enzyme usages
%   UB              vector of enzyme exchange reaction upper bounds
%   protId          string array of protein IDs matching the other output
